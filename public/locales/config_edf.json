By knowing *when* and *where* you use energy, you can identify inefficiencies and make informed decisions to reduce waste and costs.\n\n---\n\n## üìà Why Track Your Energy?\n\n- **Identify Energy Hogs:** Pinpoint appliances or processes consuming the most energy.\n- **Spot Trends:** Understand daily, weekly, or seasonal consumption patterns.\n- **Measure Impact:** Quantify the effectiveness of energy-saving initiatives.\n- **Optimise Operations:** Adjust schedules or equipment use for peak efficiency.\n- **Save Money:** Direct insights lead to targeted cost reductions.\n\n---\n\n## üîç How to Monitor Your Energy Consumption\n\n### 1. **Install a Smart Meter (If You Don't Have One)**\n- **Benefit:** Provides accurate, real-time data directly to EDF and your online account.\n- **Action:** Contact EDF to arrange a smart meter installation. It's usually free for businesses.\n- **Outcome:** Access to hourly, daily, and monthly consumption breakdowns.\n\n### 2. **Leverage Your EDF Online Account/App**\n- **Benefit:** Visualise your energy data easily, track usage against previous periods, and set budgets.\n- **Action:** Log in regularly to review your consumption. Look for spikes or consistent high usage outside of operating hours.\n- **Outcome:** Clear graphs and reports show you exactly where your energy (and money) is going.\n\n### 3. **Conduct a Manual Audit (For Specific Equipment)**\n- **Benefit:** Detailed understanding of individual appliance energy use.\n- **Action:** For key equipment, record wattage and hours of operation. Consider using plug-in energy monitors for high-usage devices.\n- **Formula:** Watts (W) √ó Hours Used (H) √∑ 1,000 = Kilowatt-hours (kWh)\n  - *Example: A 200W fridge running 10 hours a day: (200W * 10H) / 1000 = 2 kWh per day.*\n\n### 4. **Review Your Bills**\n- **Benefit:** See your overall consumption over billing periods and track your costs.\n- **Action:** Compare bills month-on-month and year-on-year. Look for unexplained increases.\n- **Outcome:** Macro view of your energy spend and progress.\n\n---\n\n## üìâ Identifying Areas for Improvement\n\nOnce you have data, look for:\n- **Off-Peak Usage:** Are lights or equipment left on overnight or during weekends?\n- **High-Usage Periods:** Can certain tasks be shifted to off-peak hours?\n- **Inefficient Equipment:** Are older appliances consuming disproportionately more energy?\n- **Temperature Control:** Is your HVAC system running inefficiently or at extreme settings?\n\n---\n\n## ‚úÖ Quick Reference Checklist\n\n- [ ] Confirm you have a smart meter installed.\n- [ ] Regularly check your EDF online account/app for consumption data.\n- [ ] Identify top 3-5 energy-consuming areas/appliances in your business.\n- [ ] Compare current energy bills with previous periods.\n- [ ] Based on data, list 1-2 potential areas for immediate efficiency improvements.\n\n---\n\n## üìö Resources\n\n- **EDF Smart Meter Support:** [Link to EDF Smart Meter info page]\n- **'Maximising Energy Efficiency' Guide:** [Link to related guide in toolkit]\n"

It helps you understand the benefits and steps to integrate clean energy into your operations.\n\n---\n\n## üåø The Power of Green Energy\n\nRenewable energy sources significantly reduce your business's carbon footprint, contribute to national grid decarbonisation, and can offer long-term cost stability. They also boost your green credentials, appealing to environmentally conscious customers and partners.\n\n---\n\n## üìä Your Renewable Energy Options\n\n### 1. **Switch to a 100% Renewable Electricity Tariff**\n- **Concept:** Your energy supplier matches your consumption with renewable electricity generated from sources like wind, solar, or hydro, verified by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs).\n- **Benefits:** Immediate and significant reduction in reported Scope 2 emissions; no upfront investment or physical changes required.\n- **Action:** Contact EDF to discuss our 100% renewable electricity tariffs for businesses. It's often a seamless transition.\n\n### 2. **Install On-Site Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Panels**\n- **Concept:** Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity for your business premises.\n- **Benefits:** Generate your own clean electricity, potentially reducing or eliminating your reliance on grid electricity during daylight hours. Long-term energy bill savings, potential for Feed-in Tariff (FIT) payments (if applicable) or Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) payments for surplus energy exported to the grid.\n- **Considerations:** Requires suitable roof space (or ground space), initial investment, and professional installation. EDF can assess your site's suitability and provide installation services.\n- **Action:** Request a solar suitability assessment from EDF.\n\n### 3. **Explore Battery Storage Solutions**\n- **Concept:** Store excess solar energy generated during the day for use at night or during peak demand, or store cheap off-peak grid electricity for use during expensive peak hours.\n- **Benefits:** Maximise self-consumption of solar energy, further reduce reliance on grid, potentially save more on electricity bills, and provide energy resilience.\n- **Considerations:** Additional upfront investment. Often paired with solar PV.\n\n### 4. **Consider Heat Pumps (For Heating & Cooling)**\n- **Concept:** Air source or ground source heat pumps efficiently transfer heat, using a small amount of electricity to move heat from one place to another, rather than generating it from scratch.\n- **Benefits:** Significantly reduce heating/cooling costs and carbon emissions compared to traditional fossil fuel systems.\n- **Considerations:** Higher upfront cost than conventional boilers, requires professional assessment and installation. More relevant for businesses with significant heating/cooling needs.\n\n---\n\n## ‚úÖ Quick Reference Checklist\n\n- [ ] Research EDF's 100% renewable electricity tariffs.\n- [ ] If interested in on-site generation, request a solar PV or heat pump assessment from EDF.\n- [ ] Understand potential financial incentives or grants available for renewable energy installations.\n- [ ] Plan how to communicate your commitment to renewable energy to your customers.\n\n---\n\n## üìö Resources\n\n- **EDF Green Tariffs:** [Link to EDF Green Tariff info page]\n- **EDF Solar Solutions:** [Link to EDF Solar for Business page]\n- **'Accessing Funding and Incentives for Green Initiatives' Guide:** [Link to related guide in toolkit]\n"
