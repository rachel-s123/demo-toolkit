# Logo Upload Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The logo upload functionality has been completely fixed! Previously, when uploading a logo to the frontend, it wasn't saving or updating the logo properly. Now the system:

1. ✅ **Uploads the logo** to Vercel Blob Storage
2. ✅ **Updates the config file** with the correct logo URL
3. ✅ **Displays the logo** in the frontend
4. ✅ **Shows upload confirmation** with preview

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **1. Frontend Logo Handling** (`src/components/tabs/BrandSetup/index.tsx`)

**Before:** Logo was uploaded but config still referenced local file paths
**After:** Logo upload now properly updates the config with Vercel Blob Storage URLs

**Key Changes:**
- Added logo preview functionality
- Added upload confirmation display
- Added logo URL tracking state
- Updated config generation to use correct logo URLs

### **2. API Upload Processing** (`api/upload-files.ts`)

**Before:** Config files were uploaded with local logo paths
**After:** API now updates config files with correct Vercel Blob Storage URLs

**Key Changes:**
- Added config file update logic after logo upload
- Fetches uploaded config file and updates logo URL
- Re-uploads updated config file to Vercel Blob Storage
- Returns updated config information to frontend

### **3. Logo URL Management**

**Before:** Logo URLs were hardcoded to local paths like `/assets/logos/brand.png`
**After:** Logo URLs are dynamically updated to Vercel Blob Storage URLs like `https://.../brand-assets/logos/brand.png`

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### **Step 1: Logo Selection**
1. User selects a logo file in the Brand Setup form
2. Logo preview is immediately shown with file details
3. Logo is stored in form state

### **Step 2: Content Generation**
1. User clicks "Generate Enhanced Brand Locale"
2. Logo path is included in the generation process
3. Config file is generated with placeholder logo path

### **Step 3: Upload Process**
1. User clicks "Upload to Backend"
2. Logo file is converted to base64 and uploaded to Vercel Blob Storage
3. Config file is uploaded to Vercel Blob Storage
4. API fetches the uploaded config file and updates the logo URL
5. Updated config file is re-uploaded to Vercel Blob Storage

### **Step 4: Frontend Update**
1. Frontend receives upload confirmation
2. Logo URL is stored in state
3. Success message is displayed with logo preview
4. Config file is updated with correct logo URL

## 🔍 Technical Details

const arrayBuffer = await formData.icon.arrayBuffer();
const base64 = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer)));
```

### **Config File Update**
```typescript
// Fetch uploaded config and update logo URL
const configResponse = await fetch(configFile.publicUrl);
const configContent = await configResponse.json();
configContent.brand.logo = logoFile.publicUrl;
```

### **Frontend State Management**
```typescript
// Track uploaded logo URL
const [uploadedLogoUrl, setUploadedLogoUrl] = useState<string | null>(null);
```
